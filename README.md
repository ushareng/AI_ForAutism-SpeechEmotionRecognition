### Problem Statement :

Inferring emotions from multiple modalities is very critical for social communication and deficits in emotion recognition are a very important marker in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. This project uses AI to help autistic individuals recognize emotions in text.

### Model :

tf-wav2vec2-base (Keras and Keras Core)

### Dataset : 

GoEmotions is a human-annotated dataset of 58k Reddit comments extracted from popular English-language subreddits and has 27 emotion categories.
